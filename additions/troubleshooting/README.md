# OpenClaw Troubleshooting Index

Use this as the entry point. Pick the issue by exact error text, then open only that file.

## Issue map

1. `pairing required` / `gateway closed (1008)`
   - File: `troubleshooting/issue-gateway-pairing-required.md`

2. `Service: LaunchAgent (not loaded)` or `Service unit not found`
   - File: `troubleshooting/issue-gateway-service-not-loaded.md`

3. `openclaw security audit --deep` warnings
   - File: `troubleshooting/issue-security-audit-warnings.md`

4. `openclaw cron add` flag errors (`unknown option --schedule`)
   - File: `troubleshooting/issue-cron-add-flags.md`

5. Telegram bot token rotation / reconnect checks
   - File: `troubleshooting/issue-telegram-token-rotation.md`

## Rule

- Run commands in the **same terminal window** unless the issue file says otherwise.
- Use one command at a time.
- Paste output before moving to fallback steps.
